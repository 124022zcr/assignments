# Introduction

In this thesis we consider selective contracting

# Model

In this section, we introduce the model which contains inline math
like $x^2$ but also displayed math^[And this is how you do a footnote]

$$
a^2 = b^2 + c^2
$$


You can number equations like this:

(@foo) $x^2 = e^x$

And then refer to it as (@foo) 

Or like this

(@foo2) $y^2 = e^x$

And then refer to it as (@foo2) 


![This is the caption\label{mylabel}](image.png)

See figure \ref{mylabel}.


You can do a table like this:

-------------------------------------------------------------
 Centered   Default           Right Left
  Header    Aligned         Aligned Aligned
----------- ------- --------------- -------------------------
   First    row                12.0 Example of a row that
                                    spans multiple lines.

  Second    row                 5.0 Here's another one. Note
                                    the blank line between
                                    rows.
-------------------------------------------------------------

Table: \label{table1} Here's the caption. It, too, may span
multiple lines.

Refer to the table as table \ref{table1}.





# Discussion

As explained in the [Introduction](#introduction) we can see that ...


Also "quotes" are done in a 'smart' way.
